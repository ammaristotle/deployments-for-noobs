# Volume 1, Part 1 - Heroku

So you've written your first fancy project. All your hard work, culminating into this incredible moment. The question is, how do you get your project on the web? How do you actually get it in the hands of those who matter?

While local development is as simple as running and playing with your `localhost`, deploying to a server _somewhere_ just sounds downright complicated.

But it doesn't have to be!

When you're first starting out, it's important to optimize for your productivity. And that means staying away from servers/configuration so you can focus on writing more code and fixing bugs.

That's where Heroku comes in. Heroku is a magical platform for your application. Magical because it works like `git`. You're probably using `git` to keep your project in version control. And to deploy it, you're not going to have to change your workflow much at all.

## A few good tips & pointers

Hopefully when you code on your project, you use branches in version control. For more info on branching in version control systems like `git`, read more [here](a link).

So, you've got branches. A good idea is to have a `master` branch and a `develop` or `dev` branch. `dev` should be where you try out all your fancy new features and `master` should resemble a somewhat stable application (and mirrors what is currently deployed right now).

## Preparing for a deployment

Let's assume you're now ready to deploy your baby. Hopefully you have a `master` branch as mentioned previously. Let's go in and actually see what it takes to deploy this.
